In addition to the goal of tracking the scores of players across the competition, the application is designed to increase competitiveness.  In dashboard mode the application will cycle through the high scores for all machines in the tournament as well as the overall point totals.  This will let players keep abreast of their old high scores that might have been overtaken by other players.  At the actual event all this will be projected up onto the wall of the tournament.  Game on!
