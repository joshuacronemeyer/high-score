<blockquote>
    <p><font size="1">First of all, we don't have a name for it
    yet. Please participate in the </font><a href="contest.htm"><font
    size="1">name the party</font></a><font size="1"> contest.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Over the past decade or so, there have been
    very few occasions (mostly weddings and funerals) that have
    gathered our extended group of old friends. As we continue to
    grow older and spread ourselves further throughout the world,
    the opportunity to gather one more time, is fleeting. </font></p>
    <p><font size="4">So, we are planning a reunion-type party.
    This is not going to be just another typical party, where you
    see people for a couple hours, find out how many kids they
    have and go home. We are planning to make it an entire
    weekend event that will most likely never be repeated.
    Planning begun 8 months in advance in order to have as many
    people attend, as possible. Please look at the list of people
    that we are inviting. Many people on the list have not been
    contacted yet, so please either contact them or forward any
    info to us and we'll invite them.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">Also, we are happy to announce that Rachel
    Wolf-Dodder Powers has taken pity on this site and will be
    helping us add graphics and taste. We'll see her in late
    February.</font></p>
    <p><font size="4">In the meantime, please read more about the
    event, send us names of people we forgot, give us your ideas,
    and let us know if you're able to attend. Nearly everyone
    we're spoken to so far has been very interested in coming....</font></p>
