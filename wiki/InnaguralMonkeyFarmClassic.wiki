These are the initial overall scoring results.  I hope to have a full breakdown of all scoring in the coming week.

If you have links to photos of the event, please share them here. Mine are still on the camera but I'll link here once they are up.

If you can't wait for the full breakdown and you are comfortable with sqlite you can directly grab the relational data here http://high-score.googlecode.com/files/highscores. Note.. this file is a bit out of date and doesn't have a few of hippie's scores.
