    <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q: What is the monkeyfarm?</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: It's 25 acre ex-farm
    about an hour away from Chicago. There are 2 houses, 2
    garages, an old barn and one other building. There are no
    crops or barn animals, aside from a stray cat. Most of the
    land is either wooded or wetlands. It is owned by h and Greg
    'hippie' Warren.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q: Why is it called the
    monkeyfarm?</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: The phone number spelled
    el mono1 and we weren't creative enough to come up with any
    other ideas.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q: What's the kitty's name?</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: We call her little
    kitty, little monkey, little hippie and spades, but she
    responds best to kissy sounds.</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: h also responds best to
    kissy sounds.</font></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q: How do I get there?</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: We're going to put
    driving directions up once we agree on security for them. In
    the meantime, email </font><a
    href="mailto:hisnice@surfree.com"><font color="#000000"
    size="4">hisnice@surfree.com</font></a></p>
    <p><font color="#000000" size="4">Q: Do you really have a
    joint checking account?</font>
    <br><font color="#000000" size="4">A: Yes. It's more
    convienent for accounting and we think it will endear us to
    the lesbian community. With that mustache, hippie shows up on
    people's gaydar fairly often anyway...</font></p>
